1
00:00:00,908 --> 00:00:02,364
Previously on "The 100"...

2
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:04,077
They're murderers raising people

3
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:05,571
to give up their bodies.

4
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:07,898
We can wait 56 years for our baby girl,

5
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:09,171
or we can get her back tonight.

6
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:12,152
The mind of the host is erased.
The brain is left unharmed.

7
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:13,919
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

8
00:00:13,944 --> 00:00:15,794
The people from Earth,
how many of them are hosts?

9
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:16,709
We don't know.

10
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:18,125
That's what you're going to find out.

11
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:19,917
Echo made herself a
Nightblood in the lab,

12
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,623
same way Abby did to Clarke.

13
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:23,544
How many people have blood alteration?

14
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:25,694
Pass us the rope, and we'll
tell you what you want to know.

15
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:28,669
- What the hell is that?
- A temporal flare.

16
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:31,066
Come on. He's getting away.

17
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:34,074
In my dreams, I see a
Commander who frightens me.

18
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:36,024
Sheidheda, the Dark Commander.

19
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,449
That's why we must keep training.

20
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:38,984
Who are you?

21
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:41,186
Josephine Lightborne. Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:43,488
Have they convinced you that
we should leave paradise?

23
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,754
Why would I leave my home?

24
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:45,730
You're not Clarke.

25
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,035
How would you like to be immortal, too?

26
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,485
So Clarke was a Commander.

27
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,553
No. I told you,

28
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,189
she wasn't a Nightblood then.

29
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,692
Abby made me pump Ontari's heart

30
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,228
with my bare hands so
her brain wouldn't melt,

31
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,829
kind of gross.

32
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,065
Hmm, kind of badass if you ask me.

33
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,519
I didn't, but thank you.

34
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,205
Hey, I am offering you immortality,

35
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,424
a chance at godhood,

36
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,464
and you can't keep your eyes open?

37
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:18,510
Yeah. Well, even gods need to sleep.

38
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,178
Why don't you, by the way?

39
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,680
Sleeplessness is common

40
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,915
the first few nights in a new host.

41
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,362
You can sleep when you're dead,

42
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:28,699
which will be never unless
you've changed your mind.

43
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,557
- I haven't.
- Good.

44
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,526
Now wake up and show me
how to be Clarke enough

45
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,965
to fool her mother...

46
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,563
because no Nightblood, no drives.

47
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,032
Fine. Lightning round.

48
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,336
What card do you play when
Abby's on her high horse?

49
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,205
The dark year, cannibalism. Yum.

50
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,708
When you want to sprinkle on some shame?

51
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,576
- Addiction.
- Inspiration?

52
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,945
Uh, Clarke in Mount Weather,

53
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,880
Clarke in the City of Light,

54
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,195
Clarke staying behind so that
you guys could go to space,

55
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,952
which was fairly awesome, by the way.

56
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,696
Yeah, unless you got in her way.

57
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:05,156
OK. You've softened the ground.

58
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,397
She's ready to break.
Take the kill shot.

59
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,463
Daddy... executed for treason

60
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,531
and turned in by Abby herself.

61
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,449
Not bad. Maybe you do pull this off.

62
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,843
That would be Madi...
oh, you know, your kid.

63
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,964
Mm.

64
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,314
Consider it a dress rehearsal.

65
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,749
Fine.

66
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:34,386
Oh, uh-uh-uh. Easy, killer.

67
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,221
First, you get me past Abby,

68
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,805
and then I wipe my friends.

69
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,466
No, no, no.

70
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,634
You don't interrupt her when she's
communing with the Commanders,

71
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:57,359
not even Sheidheda, the Dark Commander.

72
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,384
He's getting too strong.

73
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,052
That's why we have to do
the separation ritual now.

74
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,923
I'm not letting her
suffer. Madi, wake up.

75
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,485
Hey, wake up.

76
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:13,199
Clarke?

77
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,004
Yep. That's right. I'm here.

78
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,832
It was just a nightmare, OK?

79
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,063
No. It was a memory.

80
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:26,162
- But it wasn't real.
- You know that's not true.

81
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:27,482
It is real for her,

82
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,959
and ripping her out can
permanently damage her.

83
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:31,920
But it didn't, did it, Madi?

84
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,224
You don't know what that just did

85
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,872
to her mind or to the Flame.

86
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:38,489
I'm fine, OK? I'm just tired.

87
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,403
Get some rest. We should go.

88
00:03:42,428 --> 00:03:44,426
Yeah. You're right. You should.

89
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:45,866
Both of you.

90
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:03,008
Shut up. Let's start again.

91
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,684
Echo, Emori, Raven.

92
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,342
- Hey.
- It wasn't me.

93
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:21,469
Pull it together. It's show time.

94
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:24,839
Family meeting.

95
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,476
Where's Bellamy?

96
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,183
- Why? What's wrong?
- We ran into Jordan.

97
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,775
Is it true? They're immortal?

98
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:33,949
I'm sure he made it sound
worse than it really is.

99
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:36,769
They're murderers and body snatchers.

100
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,800
How much worse could it
be? We're out of here.

101
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:41,364
Hey, hey, slow down.
Where are we gonna go?

102
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,448
Murphy's right. The plan doesn't change.

103
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:46,575
We stay and learn as
much from them as we can

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,217
so we can build our own compound.

105
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,920
Bellamy's out scouting
a location as we speak.

106
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:52,865
He went without me?

107
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:56,867
This whole body-snatching
thing just really lit a fire.

108
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:58,663
He's out with a foraging party.

109
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:00,053
You guys were still with Ryker.

110
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:01,777
You let him go alone?

111
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:03,553
OK. Wait a second. Back up, Clarke.

112
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:06,212
You expect us to continue to play nice?

113
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:10,317
We do still need Ryker to tell us

114
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,463
how to bend the radiation field.

115
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,271
No. I'll figure it out myself.

116
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,649
Raven, I know this is hard,

117
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,391
but we've all done things that
we're not proud of to survive.

118
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,604
I haven't.

119
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:27,870
Fine. I'll try.

120
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,346
I'll go with her,

121
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:34,201
make sure she doesn't start a war.

122
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,771
I'm going after Bellamy.

123
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:49,004
Echo's going to be a problem.

124
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,582
I'll send Jade to keep an eye on her.

125
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,454
Yeah. Back to Bellamy,

126
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:56,714
there's no foraging party, is there?

127
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,089
Sure, there is, every morning.

128
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,017
He's just not on it.

129
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,340
See, he found out that I wasn't Clarke.

130
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:04,122
Swear to God, if you killed him...

131
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,074
I didn't, but I will if I have to.

132
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,495
You don't get it.

133
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,011
If Bellamy knows that Clarke is dead,

134
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:13,707
then all of this is for nothing.

135
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,581
He may was well just kill himself now.

136
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:17,567
That seems a tad impulsive.

137
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,512
I was thinking of giving
it till second moon.

138
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:22,013
That's when the
foraging party comes back

139
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:24,068
and Echo finds out I was lying.

140
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:25,788
You have until then to get him

141
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:26,929
on the side of the angels.

142
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,165
The angels being us?

143
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,852
We're all the hero of
our own story, John.

144
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:34,861
Come on. I'll take you to him.

145
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:40,336
Follow Echo.

146
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,167
Let me go!

147
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,885
What the hell are you doing?

148
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,607
Let me out!

149
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,440
Murphy.

150
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,330
Bellamy.

151
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,083
Heh. Oh, you figured it out, too, huh?

152
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:09,872
I bet that I can make
something to cut this strap.

153
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:14,757
- Who else knows?
- Nobody yet. Just us.

154
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,964
Tried to offer me a deal.

155
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:21,755
What deal?

156
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:25,470
We agree not to retaliate,

157
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,672
they help us build our compound.

158
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,141
And what did you say?

159
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:32,754
What do you think I said?

160
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:35,658
It's Clarke.

161
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,066
She might not have been
my favorite of late.

162
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,151
She's still one of ours.

163
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,027
She cared about you, Murphy.

164
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,710
I know that it may not
have always seemed like it,

165
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,227
but she did.

166
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:50,977
She cared about all of us,

167
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:55,166
and she would never let us die here.

168
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:57,877
You saying we should take the deal?

169
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:01,680
No. No. You were right.

170
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,157
We don't need them to help
us build our own compound.

171
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:09,422
We kill them all, and we take theirs.

172
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:14,601
Where's Blodreina when you need her?

173
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:32,370
Bioluminescence. Cool.

174
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,275
What if it's another trap?

175
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,568
You don't trap something
you think is already dead.

176
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,103
Quiet. On me.

177
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:50,598
Don't move. Don't make me shoot you.

178
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,665
Drop it.

179
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,368
Octavia, what is it? What's wrong? Move.

180
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,942
- Fascinating.
- Oh, it's spreading.

181
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,452
- What is this?
- I assume she went under,

182
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,736
leaving only her hand
exposed to temporal flare,

183
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:27,946
though not fully, or it'd
be fossilized like the trees.

184
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,008
I can help her,

185
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,978
not at the point of a gun.

186
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,528
Good choice.

187
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,003
There's medicine, but to get it,

188
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:45,481
we need to go back to the
place where it happened.

189
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:46,895
I'll give her 3 hours tops.

190
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,154
Before the time dilation
reaches her brain

191
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:51,410
and she's dead.

192
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,302
Fine, but then you're taking me
to the old man, or you're dead.

193
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:01,092
Ah, so you're looking for Gabriel.

194
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:02,727
What did Russell promise you?

195
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:04,680
40 vestal virgins and a side dish

196
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,556
of none of your damn business.

197
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,631
You're not boring. I give you that.

198
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,417
Channel the radiation through
a spatial light modulator

199
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:25,075
with a calculated phase variation.

200
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:26,902
And it follows a curved
trajectory in free space.

201
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:28,120
Cool. Got it.

202
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,917
We jury-rig the security pylons

203
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,242
Eligius used for the prisoners

204
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,251
- to handle the radiation.
- We provide the reactor fuel.

205
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,708
Yeah, out of the goodness
of your own hearts, I'm sure.

206
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:38,820
Did I miss something?

207
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,942
No. I did.

208
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:44,266
I think it's time to get some rest.

209
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:45,780
How long have you known?

210
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:48,116
No. You go. I don't need rest.

211
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,514
I need to get this done as fast as I can

212
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:52,383
so we get the hell out of here.

213
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,146
You know, as someone
who's lived with pain

214
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:01,971
for longer than I can remember,

215
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,173
I can get wanting a new body,

216
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,759
just wouldn't murder
someone else for it.

217
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:09,278
It's not murder. We don't force people.

218
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,714
Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot.

219
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:15,165
You raise them from birth
to believe you're gods

220
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,610
so they sacrifice themselves willingly

221
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:19,901
for the greater glory of you.

222
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:22,291
It must be nice to be worshipped.

223
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:23,855
No, not really.

224
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,699
This you and your mom?

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,487
Priya, right? Hallowed be her name.

226
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:40,810
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?

227
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:43,818
I'm sure she's way more
important than some barmaid.

228
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:48,784
Of course, Delilah wasn't
just a barmaid, was she?

229
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:50,973
She was a daughter and a friend.

230
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:52,583
I was just a kid.

231
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:57,456
Russell killed us in the first red sun

232
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:59,247
not long after this was taken.

233
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:06,586
I didn't ask to be resurrected.

234
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:13,128
No, but...

235
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:16,111
you're Ryker the Ninth
now, though, right,

236
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,646
8 bodies?

237
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,254
How old were you when
you snatched this one?

238
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,442
206.

239
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:31,478
I'll look at that reactor now.

240
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,469
Item number one on our list...

241
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,858
red sun mushroom for
the adjustment protocol.

242
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,243
Oh, Josephine Prime's favorite ritual,

243
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:40,469
reason I miss her.

244
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:43,672
Be respectful. We're still
in the Offering Grove.

245
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,981
Who leaves to scout without a map?

246
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:08,579
Mercy.

247
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:15,239
I'll get you out of here.

248
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:28,224
Please. Mercy. They're inside me.

249
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,135
Stop! No.

250
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,740
You were in the tavern.
Why are you following me?

251
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:53,943
I have my orders. Let's go.

252
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,415
He's in pain.

253
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,913
Not that it's any of your business,

254
00:14:57,915 --> 00:14:59,571
but he chose this path.

255
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:02,579
Jade...

256
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,876
You're strong. You can do this.

257
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:13,262
Join me.

258
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,735
I would, my friend,

259
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,934
but I have another charge.

260
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,570
You know him?

261
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:22,826
He's the guard who lowered the shield

262
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,207
that let your ship in
the night they took Rose.

263
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:27,077
He blames himself for her death.

264
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:28,662
He should blame me.

265
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:31,872
Now let's go.

266
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,918
- Mercy.
- I said no!

267
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:03,753
Hey, save your energy.
You're gonna need it.

268
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,117
Yeah? For what, another war?

269
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,885
Is that really what Clarke would want?

270
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,806
I don't know what Clarke would want.

271
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,256
It's too bad we can't ask her.

272
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:14,119
We know she wanted to do better.

273
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:16,534
Somehow I don't think
risking all of our lives

274
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,360
for revenge is a step
in the right direction.

275
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:24,793
Why aren't you restrained like me?

276
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,395
I don't know.

277
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,677
Maybe I seem less likely
to rip their heads off.

278
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:36,624
Why are you really here, Murphy?

279
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,523
You really want to know?

280
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,859
- Yeah.
- Fine.

281
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,810
I'm here to convince
you to take the deal.

282
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,828
There. I said it.

283
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,950
Why am I not surprised?

284
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,500
What did you see when you died, Murphy?

285
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:58,736
OK. I tried to save my own ass?

286
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,601
Yeah. I am,

287
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,710
but I'm also saving yours, just
like I did during the red sun.

288
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:09,131
Bellamy, if we take this deal,

289
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:10,466
we get everything we want.

290
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:12,091
We get to live.

291
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:15,264
Not Clarke.

292
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:18,155
We can't bring her back.

293
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,114
We can make sure the rest of us survive,

294
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,826
starting with you.

295
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:24,967
If you don't take this deal,
Josephine will kill you.

296
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:27,584
- Then let her try.
- Oh, so that's it, then?

297
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,451
We start another war? We
destroy another planet?

298
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,303
Is that what you want?

299
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:34,058
Is that what Monty would have wanted?

300
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,897
Hey, Monty... listen to me.

301
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,217
Monty would be ashamed of you.

302
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:47,279
Maybe he would be,

303
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,937
or maybe he'd see that
this is how we do better.

304
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,098
Get out.

305
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,321
Don't worry.

306
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:14,196
I'll do my best to make
sure they only kill you.

307
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,553
Wait. Tell me if I got this right.

308
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:25,548
The old man is actually
the original Gabriel,

309
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:29,224
Prime number 13, only he lost
his stomach for immortality,

310
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,423
so he became a terrorist
to kill his own people.

311
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,596
He'd call it a moral awakening.

312
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,361
Don't we all?

313
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:38,702
So you're looking for redemption...

314
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:40,171
is that it?

315
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:42,439
By helping Russell kill Gabriel.

316
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,108
I can offer you a better way.

317
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,228
No. Screw redemption.

318
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,788
Ah, I see.

319
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,658
Did Russell tell you your child
will be considered worthless?

320
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:02,793
You don't have the blood,
and neither will she.

321
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:03,894
They'll call her a null.

322
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,503
She won't be able to bear children.

323
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,769
She'll clean toilets or

324
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:10,113
volunteer to die as a
guard or attend to the dead.

325
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,903
- At least she'll be alive.
- If you could call it that.

326
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:14,403
Save your breath.

327
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,674
I'm not joining your little rebellion.

328
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:19,934
My days of fighting for
lost causes are over.

329
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,356
Really?

330
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:26,150
Then explain Octavia.

331
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:28,219
She's as lost as they
come, yet you help her.

332
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:29,543
Easy.

333
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,826
You know what I think?

334
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:37,951
I think you don't want her to end up

335
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,568
on the same page of your
history books as you.

336
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,399
You see a lot.

337
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,051
How is this possible?

338
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,387
That's a question for the old man.

339
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:54,699
Maybe he'll answer it
before you kill him.

340
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,004
Here it comes.

341
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,964
Tree sap? That's your miracle cure?

342
00:20:02,162 --> 00:20:04,803
So help me God, if
you're just buying time

343
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,999
for your friends to come and save you...

344
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:07,489
"Buying time."

345
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,490
Interesting choice of words.

346
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:12,756
I prefer time in a bottle.

347
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,205
Leave me alone!

348
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,473
Heda.

349
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:50,648
I see him in mirrors.

350
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:55,089
Soon, he'll be everywhere.

351
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,090
That's why we need to do
the separation ritual now.

352
00:20:58,115 --> 00:20:59,199
Where's Clarke?

353
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,301
I don't think we have
time to wait anymore, Heda.

354
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,161
You'll have to be strong without her.

355
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,729
Now, I've never done this before,

356
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,298
but, luckily, Raven kept Titus's book.

357
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,689
It contains the wisdom
of Bekka Pramheda.

358
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:12,080
The ritual is simple,

359
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,706
but you'll need to
focus like never before.

360
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:16,274
You won't be alone.

361
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,642
According to this, there's a dream space

362
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,950
in the Flame where you can summon

363
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:21,082
the other Commanders
to confront Sheidheda.

364
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:23,496
But if anything goes wrong,

365
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:25,519
you need to hold on to a good memory,

366
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:28,886
let it be like a shelter that
keeps you safe in a storm.

367
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:31,593
Do you have that memory?

368
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,039
The day I met Clarke,

369
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:38,041
before the bear trap.

370
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:40,569
Perfect.

371
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:45,028
Now lean back. Close your eyes.

372
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:48,651
Concentrate and repeat after me.

373
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:16,118
No. You're a liar.

374
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,743
Heda?

375
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:41,379
What is this? Let me go.

376
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:44,578
We're not through. The
ritual takes repetition.

377
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:47,345
The restraint is to protect
you in case he breaks through.

378
00:23:48,842 --> 00:23:50,428
Let's start again.

379
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,863
Does Clarke know about this?

380
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:55,472
Clarke's not here. Now sit down.

381
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:10,823
Sound mind, sound body, sound heart.

382
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:13,148
Blessed be the Primes.

383
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,762
Any progress on the Kane problem?

384
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,564
"The Kane problem"?

385
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:29,133
Is that what you think this is?

386
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,370
No. No. There's no progress.

387
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:34,619
That's not what I meant.

388
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:41,720
What if I told you the Primes
had a way to save Kane...

389
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,368
But to do it,

390
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,758
you'd have to turn him
into a Nightblood first?

391
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:54,477
What are you talking about?

392
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,928
Come inside, and I'll show you.

393
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,621
They call it the miracle of sanctum.

394
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:04,168
All you need to do

395
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,380
is teach them how to make Nightblood,

396
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:10,341
and then that's yours...
well, Kane's, I mean.

397
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:14,287
You make him a Nightblood,
you download his mind.

398
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:16,914
That's it. It really is a miracle.

399
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,917
His mind is gonna go in
another person's body?

400
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,123
But we've done worse, haven't we...

401
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:25,256
the culling on the Ark,

402
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:28,067
Mount Weather, Becca's lab.

403
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:33,041
No. We did that to survive,
for all of us to survive.

404
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:36,136
And we did. We survived.

405
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:40,361
Now we get our humanity back.

406
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,439
By taking innocent lives?

407
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:46,854
Russell told me that his
people would volunteer for this.

408
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,913
If the Primes can make Nightblood,

409
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,015
then they can bring
back all of them at once.

410
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,516
It would be the most spectacular thing

411
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:53,751
that's ever happened here,

412
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:54,832
and people would love you for it.

413
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:56,860
That doesn't sound like you, Clarke.

414
00:25:58,096 --> 00:25:59,539
I know.

415
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:04,746
I know. It's just...

416
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,554
Kane should be here, Mom,

417
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,402
more than the rest of us combined.

418
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:13,120
We've been trying to be the good guys,

419
00:26:13,144 --> 00:26:15,986
but he's just good.

420
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,586
Yeah.

421
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,142
Yes. He is.

422
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,250
And this isn't just about you.

423
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,386
We need him more than ever.

424
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:30,242
If he could negotiate peace in Polis,

425
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:33,212
then he can save us here and now.

426
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,017
I wasn't aware that we needed saving.

427
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:39,997
We don't.

428
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,967
It's just a figure of speech.

429
00:26:43,675 --> 00:26:45,175
Listen to me.

430
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:47,592
Mom,

431
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,809
I know you blame yourself
for Dad's death...

432
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:57,720
And I know you blame your addiction

433
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:01,226
for what happened to Kane.

434
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:06,283
Mom, I'm afraid of
what will happen to you

435
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:09,062
if you lose him, too.

436
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:14,946
And I can't lose you.

437
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:33,983
OK. I'll do it.

438
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:45,258
The Lees have been
part of our Prime family

439
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:47,683
for over 200 years.

440
00:27:47,685 --> 00:27:51,523
How can we just erase them forever?

441
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:53,115
We don't really have a choice.

442
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,539
I've done my job.

443
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:56,325
Abby will show us how
to make Nightblood,

444
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:58,561
but only if we bring her lover back.

445
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:00,618
Why come to me, and not your father?

446
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,833
Dad thinks with is heart...

447
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:05,901
this body is proof of that...

448
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:07,670
but we have to be practical.

449
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:09,105
We have zero hosts,

450
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:11,240
so we either die in these bodies

451
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:14,577
or we wipe the Lees and live forever.

452
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:18,814
Mom, once Abby shows you
how to make Nightblood,

453
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:21,717
we'll never be on ice again.

454
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:27,319
The best part... no
more nulls, no oblation.

455
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:29,825
Anyone can be a host.

456
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:32,661
We'll have the genetic
pick of the litter.

457
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:41,209
Thank you for your sacrifice.

458
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:05,743
Mind turning that off?

459
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,956
Hey, don't touch that.

460
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:12,601
I'm trying to work. Turn it off.

461
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:15,905
My second host built that, Alejo,

462
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:18,974
made it when he was 12
out of recycled radios.

463
00:29:19,316 --> 00:29:21,410
At least they were still
good for something, huh?

464
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:23,679
Yeah. An offering to the gods, huh?

465
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,654
How do you do that?

466
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,254
How do you make something
beautiful seem so profane?

467
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,884
News flash... keeping a gift

468
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:32,808
from somebody whose body you stole

469
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,490
is profane.

470
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:36,292
How about this?

471
00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:38,048
This was given to my sixth host,

472
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:40,229
Tyman Averi, from his mother Annabel.

473
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:43,399
Every month, we celebrate
Ty's life together.

474
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:44,424
Is that profane?

475
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,908
So you haven't forgotten
the people who died for you.

476
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:50,973
- I'm touched.
- I think about them every day.

477
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:54,243
Hey, Abby needs you.

478
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:55,578
What for?

479
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,013
I don't know, something about Kane.

480
00:29:58,015 --> 00:30:00,649
She needs to get up
to the mothership ASAP.

481
00:30:01,306 --> 00:30:02,641
I'll relieve you here.

482
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:05,777
Have a nice flight.

483
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,594
Hey, can I ask you a question?

484
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:15,772
Is this your last body?

485
00:30:19,741 --> 00:30:22,210
Yeah. Didn't think so.

486
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,685
Went to the spot we
chose for our settlement.

487
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:39,847
Bellamy wasn't there.

488
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,341
You already know that.

489
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:52,252
Where is he?

490
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:55,554
Please. Cut me loose.

491
00:30:56,515 --> 00:31:00,312
The vines, I can feel
them under my skin.

492
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:02,445
Who sent you?

493
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,804
You said you had another charge.

494
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:09,886
I know what I said.

495
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,797
Clarke said Bellamy went to scout.

496
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,328
No one knew I was coming out
here except for my people.

497
00:31:20,436 --> 00:31:23,036
The Primes knew she was a Nightblood.

498
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,668
Oh, my God...

499
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:32,151
that's not Clarke.

500
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,984
She's a Prime, and
you're protecting her.

501
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:43,953
I swear on my mother's soul,

502
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:46,993
if Bellamy is dead,

503
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:50,469
I'll slit your master's throat.

504
00:31:50,997 --> 00:31:53,773
He's not dead, OK?

505
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:56,930
He has until second moon.

506
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:01,391
Thank you for being truthful.

507
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,336
I'll come back for you if I'm in time.

508
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,625
I don't want to fight, OK?

509
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:27,265
Why are you here?

510
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:30,937
Because we're both
struggling to live with this.

511
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:32,976
And I was hoping

512
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:35,195
maybe we could help
each other through it.

513
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,559
You went to my father?

514
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,403
I take big swings.

515
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,591
What are you doing?

516
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:51,832
Saving us.

517
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:54,168
He knows you killed Clarke.

518
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:55,896
And unlike the snake behind you,

519
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:57,553
he will cry over spilled milk.

520
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:58,609
Enough.

521
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:02,043
What the hell's the matter with you?

522
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,998
Have you become so callous
to the feeling of others

523
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:07,107
that you don't remember what it's like

524
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:09,334
to lose someone you love?

525
00:33:12,578 --> 00:33:14,031
I know you're in pain.

526
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:18,014
I know you want revenge. I would too.

527
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,968
We had a chance to
bring back our daughter

528
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:21,091
and we took it.

529
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:23,178
We didn't consider the consequences.

530
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,835
- For God's sake...
- Be quiet.

531
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,624
Maybe you should just let the man speak.

532
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:28,686
- Shut up, Murphy.
- Shut up, Murphy.

533
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:33,999
I think you should hear him out.

534
00:33:34,307 --> 00:33:35,850
I think we can trust him.

535
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,022
- Do you now?
- You can.

536
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,186
Look. I can't bring your friend back,

537
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:44,362
but I can guarantee safety
for the rest of your people.

538
00:33:44,387 --> 00:33:45,950
We'll share everything we've learned

539
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,745
about surviving on this moon.

540
00:33:49,106 --> 00:33:51,037
Why did our ship just take off?

541
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:53,174
Abby's showing them
how to make Nightblood.

542
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,020
I take it she doesn't know
that her daughter is dead.

543
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:01,331
You're gonna have to kill her, too.

544
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:04,217
You think my need for revenge is strong?

545
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,789
There's only one way this ends.

546
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:09,006
Bellamy, stop, all right?

547
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:12,170
You don't want them to
kill all of us. Just think.

548
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:14,764
Josephine!

549
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:19,063
Bellamy, come on. Don't do this.

550
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:23,223
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Violence is all they know.

551
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:27,533
If killing him is what you need,

552
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:32,194
then do it, but let
the violence end here...

553
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,625
An eye for an eye.

554
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:44,550
Big swings.

555
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,827
So what's the verdict?

556
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:10,843
The spreading seems to have slowed.

557
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:13,765
That's a good thing, right?

558
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:16,816
It's buying you some time.

559
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,214
I don't understand.

560
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,667
It sped up my healing.
Why is it slowing hers?

561
00:35:21,692 --> 00:35:24,191
I supposed it's because
you don't heal old age,

562
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:26,189
but the truth is, I have no idea.

563
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,040
How long do I have?

564
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,384
Not long,

565
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:32,751
a day, maybe two.

566
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:35,775
You said it would cure her.

567
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:37,704
Actually, I said it might.

568
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:41,017
Whoa. What are you doing?

569
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:42,446
Cut it off.

570
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:45,727
Bold move. Will it work?

571
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:49,220
And if you say, "it might,"
we're gonna have a problem.

572
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:54,367
Hold on. Your arm's movement.

573
00:35:56,546 --> 00:35:57,992
I...

574
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:00,581
I want to try something.

575
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:05,079
Here.

576
00:36:05,841 --> 00:36:07,727
Let it scrape against the boulder.

577
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:10,688
Don't try to control your
hand. Just let it move.

578
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:12,931
Close your eyes.

579
00:36:33,997 --> 00:36:37,441
That's enough. Take a look.

580
00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:45,626
A logarithmic spiral,

581
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:48,009
the shape of the anomaly.

582
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:49,767
It's the source of the temporal flares.

583
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,477
I don't understand. What does it mean?

584
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:56,038
It's not just a tremor.

585
00:36:57,803 --> 00:36:59,815
It's a message.

586
00:37:01,707 --> 00:37:03,723
The anomaly's calling you...

587
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:09,590
just like it called me.

588
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,920
I guess we better see what
the hell this anomaly wants.

589
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:44,128
Bellamy...

590
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,381
what's going on?

591
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:53,745
Clarke's dead.

592
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:07,817
So when do we attack?

593
00:38:08,763 --> 00:38:10,264
We don't.

594
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:15,836
We do what Clarke would have done.

595
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:20,112
We survive.

596
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,571
Madi, hey...

597
00:38:39,157 --> 00:38:41,062
I have something to tell you.

598
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,666
I'm so sorry,

599
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,705
but training will help
you get through this.

600
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:27,506
Heda?

601
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:35,082
This is your fault.

602
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:37,617
- I know you're upset.
- "Upset"?

603
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,771
They killed her,

604
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:43,523
and now Bellamy says
we can't get revenge.

605
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:47,647
I understand why you might want that,

606
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:48,934
but if revenge leads to war...

607
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:51,339
No more lessons.

608
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:01,136
Heda, we can get through this together.

609
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:04,424
No.

610
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:10,081
As your Commander, you
are hereby banished.

611
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:11,952
Heda, think.

612
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:14,407
I'll have no choice but
to obey your command,

613
00:40:14,432 --> 00:40:15,664
and you need my help now.

614
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:17,127
I said go...

615
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:19,846
now...

616
00:40:21,142 --> 00:40:23,253
before I kill you.

617
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:37,482
Shut up.

618
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,416
♪ I ♪

619
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:25,205
♪ Don't belong ♪

620
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:33,955
♪ Slowly slip back
inside of my mind ♪

621
00:41:36,016 --> 00:41:38,366
Clarke, I love you so much.

622
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:39,484
Mom?

623
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:41,108
I'm scared.

624
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:43,015
Clarke...

625
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,673
I'm afraid.

626
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,847
You don't have to do this without...

627
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:50,050
I will not let you die in this war.

628
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:52,385
Can we talk about something else?

629
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:54,721
We don't have to talk at all.

630
00:41:57,555 --> 00:42:00,055
